The Github workflow

git init  <--- to initialize when starting a project

git checkout [filename.md] <--- used to go back to previous version (ie. not committ a messed up version)

point is, commit often so as to have different versions of your work avaiable in case you need it.
  something might go wrong at some point so you want to have the version immediately previous available to you. 

use  git add .  to commit everything from the director you're in

then use git commit -m "[insert explanation]  to place notes

you can use  git diff  to see what has been changed
